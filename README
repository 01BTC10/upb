upb - a minimalist implementation of protocol buffers.

For API documentation, see the header files.

To build:
$ make

Other useful targets:
$ make test
$ make benchmark

Issue tracking is on Google Code:
  http://code.google.com/p/upb/issues/list

A manual is forthcoming, for now see wiki docs at:
  https://github.com/haberman/upb/wiki

API and ABI are both subject to change!  Please do not distribute as a shared
library for this reason (for now at least).

TODO
====

The issue tracker contains small-to-medium tasks that need doing; but here are
the major things that are broken or not yet implemented yet:

- serialization isn't written yet (only deserialization)

- the language extensions that exist so far (Python and Lua) are totally
  incomplete/broken.  They are not usable for anything yet.  This will
  be remedied very soon.
