upb - a minimalist implementation of protocol buffers.

- For API documentation, see the header files.
- To build type "make".


ROADMAP OF THE SOURCE
=====================

benchmark/
  Benchmarks of upb and other protocol buffer implementations.
descriptor/
  Files that describe the format of Protocol Buffer "descriptors", which are
  protocol buffers that describe the format of other protocol buffers.  These
  are used extensively inside upb.
labs/
  Code that is not part of upb, but contains efficiency-related experiments
  about alternate ways of implementing things.  When possible, these are
  benchmarked by the tests in benchmark/.  We also test these with the tests
  in tests/, to ensure that the alternate implementations are actually correct.
src/
  The core source directory.  builds into src/libupb.a.
tests/
  Unit tests.
tools/
  Command-line tools like the upb compiler.
