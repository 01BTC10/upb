upb - a minimalist implementation of protocol buffers.

- For API documentation, see the header files.
- To build type "make".


ROADMAP OF THE SOURCE
=====================

benchmark/
  Benchmarks of upb and other protocol buffer implementations.
core/
  The core source directory.  builds into core/libupb.a.  Contains only the
  very core library, which is capable of loading descriptors given the
  appropriate decoder.  Does not even contain decoders for the standard
  formats like the protobuf text and binary formats.
descriptor/
  Files that describe the format of Protocol Buffer "descriptors", which are
  protocol buffers that describe the format of other protocol buffers.  These
  are used extensively inside upb.
labs/
  Code that is not part of upb, but contains efficiency-related experiments
  about alternate ways of implementing things.  When possible, these are
  benchmarked by the tests in benchmark/.  We also test these with the tests
  in tests/, to ensure that the alternate implementations are actually correct.
stream/
  Implementations of streaming protobuf encoders and decoders.
tests/
  Unit tests.
tools/
  Command-line tools like the upb compiler.
